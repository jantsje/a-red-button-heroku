      <p>Welcome to the first task. In this task you have to make a choice between two options: A and B.
          These options specify a bonus payment for you as well as a bonus payment that will be sent to the
          charity Red Cross on your behalf. </p>

      <p>Red Cross prevents and alleviates human suffering in the face of emergencies by mobilizing
          the power of volunteers and the generosity of donors.
          You can learn more about Red Cross
          <u><a href = "https://www.redcross.org.uk/" target="_blank">here</a></u>. </p>

<p>An <b>example</b> of bonus payments are shown below. The actual bonus payment table may be different. <br>
          In the table, YOU are represented by the BLUE participant
          <img width="20px" src="{% static 'blue-you.jpg' %}"/>
          and Red Cross is represented by the RED CROSS <img width="20px" src="{% static 'red-cross.jpg' %}"/>
          symbol. The numbers in <b><span style="color:#4EB3E6">blue</span></b> are your bonus payments
          and the numbers in <b><span style="color:red">red</span></b> are the bonus payments of the Red Cross.</p>
