      <p>You will be presented with a <b>sequence of numbers</b> which will appear at random times on the screen in the next page. At the end of the experiment, we will ask you to tell us which was the <b>highest number</b> that you saw. If the number you answer is actually the highest number that appeared on screen, we will add an extra 10 cents to your final payoffs. </p>
